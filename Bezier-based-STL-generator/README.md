* A MATLAB GUI to export 3D revolved surface object as STL file. The surface is built by revolving a Bezier curve. The GUI provides a Bezier curve drawing with editable control points. The revolve axis is defined using the "m" and "b" parameters (y = mx + b).
* This [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/qCMfa-7j9yA) demonstrates the GUI.
* The main file for running the code is "FinalProject.fig".
